			<p>
				Every XML and HTML document in an HTML page is represented by a Document object
                <br />
                The document's address is the URL associated with a Document (as defined in the DOM standard). It is initially set when the Document is created, but that can change during the lifetime of the Document
                <br/>
                The document's referrer is an absolute URL that can be set when the Document is created. If it is not explicitly set, then its value is the empty string.
