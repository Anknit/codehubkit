        The sources of knowledge are uncountable. What is accounted for in formal education and textbooks, and now even the internet, is but a fraction of what exists in the collective cognition of the world we inhabit. Bits of knowledge are dispersed all around us, be it the difference between a good sponge cake and one that is just the best, or getting the slant of the wrist just right for that perfect backhand stroke, or learning the nuances of playing the right chords on the guitar that sound just great. This collective wisdom resides in the minds of the millions that inhabit this world, and some of it is endangered to be lost forever as the world trundles on at a fast pace. That would indeed be sad.
